        <h2>Kabuki's Influence</h2>
        <p>Kabuki subject matter creates distinctions between the historical play (jidaimono) and the domestic play (sewamono). A Kabuki program generally presents them in that order, separated by one or two dance plays featuring ghosts, courtesans, and other exotic creatures. It ends with a lively dance finale (ōgiri shosagoto) with a large cast.</p>

        <p>Although the basic purposes of Kabuki are to entertain and to allow the actors to demonstrate their skills, there is a didactic element, an ideal represented by the notion of kanzen-chōaku (“reward the virtuous and punish the wicked”). Thus, the plays often present conflicts involving such religious ideas as the transitory nature of the world (from Buddhism), and the importance of duty (from Confucianism), as well as more general moral sentiments. Tragedy occurs when morality conflicts with human passions. Structurally, the plays are typically composed of two or more themes in a complex suji (plot), but they lack the strong unifying element for which Western drama strives. Kabuki plays include a variety of intermingled episodes which develop toward a final dramatic climax.</p>

        <p>Despite the ease with which it can assimilate new forms, Kabuki is a very formalized theatre. It retains numerous conventions adapted from earlier forms of theatre that were performed in shrines and temples. Kabuki dance is probably the best-known feature of Kabuki. Rarely is an opportunity missed to insert dancing, whether the restrained, flowing movement of the onnagata or the exaggerated posturings of the male characters. The acting in Kabuki can be so stylized that it becomes virtually indistinguishable from dancing.</p>

        <p>At present, regular performances are held at the National Theatre in Tokyo. The city was also home to the Kabuki Theatre (Kabuki-za), which closed in 2010. An office tower—which includes the theatre—was opened on the site in 2013. Other theatres have occasional performances. Troupes of Kabuki actors also perform outside Tokyo. There are several such companies, but their memberships often overlap. At the National Theatre the length of an average program is about four hours. The theatre stresses the importance of the play itself, trying to maintain the historical tradition and to preserve Kabuki as a classical form.</p>
