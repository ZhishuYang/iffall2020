                    <p>I've seen the world, done it all</p>
                    <p>Had my cake now</p>
                    <p>Diamonds, brilliant, in Bel-Air now</p>
                    <p>Hot summer nights, mid July</p>
                    <p>When you and I were forever wild</p>
                    <p>The crazy days, city lights</p>
                    <p>The way you'd play with me like a child</p>

                    <p>Will you still love me</p>
                    <p>When I'm no longer young and beautiful?</p>
                    <p>Will you still love me</p>
                    <p>When I've got nothing but my aching soul?</p>
                    <p>I know you will, I know you will</p>
                    <p>I know that you will</p>
                    <p>Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?</p>

                <div>
                    <p>I've seen the world, lit it up</p>
                    <p>As my stage now</p>
                    <p>Channeling angels in a new age now</p>
                    <p>Hot summer days, rock and roll</p>
                    <p>The way you play for me at your show</p>
                    <p>And all the ways, I got to know</p>
                    <p>Your pretty face and electric soul</p>

                    <p>Please let me bring my man</p>
                    <p>When he comes tell me that you'll let him in</p>
                    <p>Father tell me if you can</p>
                    <p>All that grace, all that body</p>
                    <p>All that face, makes me wanna party</p>
                    <p>He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds</p>
