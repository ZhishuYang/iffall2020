        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <p>1. Hi, my name is Zhishu Yang. I am a junior studying in communication design with a second major in psychology.</p>
        <p>2. I'm from China, and  I have strong interests in psychology and novels. I take this class because I want to explore the field that I have never touched before. Moreover, this class is connected with design, and I believe this class can open a new door for my design path.</p>
        <p>3. I have no experience in computer science, but I am excited to learn it.</p>
        <p>4. I hope I can design my own personal website with beautiful designs in it so that I can put my portfolio in.</p>
        <p>5. I need to adjust my designs according to different sizes of screens. Also, I believe designing on screen can give more choices and chances to intereact with the audience.</p>
        <p>6. I think <a href="https://www.found-studio.com">Visit found-studio.com!</a> exemplifies effective design because these moving images really catch people's eyes, and readers can make their own choices when viewing the website.</p>
        <p>7. I think <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/sites/utrust">Visit awwwards.com!</a> exemplifies effective communication because it contains clear figures with vivid colors so that I can easily get the information. Moreover, I can see other people's judges and share my ideas here.</p>
        <p>8. I think <a href="https://www.hellomonday.com/">Visit hellomonday.com!</a> exemplifies both of characters because it has an interesting and intereacting animation first, which conveys meanings and draws my attentions. Then, it has clear categories that mark different information. </p>
