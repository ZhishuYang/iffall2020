                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Slice the pork thinly and then add pinch of salt, starch, cooking wine and water. Combine well and set aside for 10 minutes. The pork slices should be well coated with the starch. This is to g uarantee the thin outside layer protecting the pork overcooked.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        In a wok, add 1 tablespoon of oil, fry half of the chili pepper, half of Sichuan peppercorn, star anise over lowest fire until aroma. Then add ginger, garlic and green onion whites, cook for around another 30 seconds.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Add doubanjiang and dou-chi in, fry until you can see the red oil come out.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Pour around 1L water in. Simmer for around 15-20 minutes with lid covered. During this process, you may smell the strong aroma bought by the broth.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        During the process, in another pot, cook water spinach for around 30 seconds in boiling water (with pinch of salt and several drops of oil). Transfer out and lay in the bottom of the serving bowl.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Grasp the pork again to make sure they are evenly coated. Turn up fire and add the pork slices in and cook until the broth begin to boil again. Wait for around 20 to 30 seconds and transfer them out immediately.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Heat up around 2 tablespoons of cooking oil again in wok with the left chili pepper and Sichuan pepper over slow fire until really hot (you can smell the strong aroma and the chili pepper begins to turn dark). Evenly pour the oil on the surface of the serving bowl. Be careful during the process; do not get burnt!
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Serve directly or garnish with green onion and coriander.
                    </li>
